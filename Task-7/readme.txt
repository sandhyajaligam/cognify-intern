# Task 7: Component-Based Styling — Where Data Meets Intelligence

## Objective

The goal of this task is to implement **component-based styling** using a CSS framework like **Bootstrap**. This approach helps streamline development and maintain design consistency across the website while applying modular design principles.

## Overview

In this task, the existing webpage was refactored to utilize a CSS framework. Components from the framework were used for layout, navigation, and other UI elements. Custom styling was applied where necessary to align with the project’s visual theme.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap 5** (or another framework if used — e.g., Tailwind CSS)
- **Custom CSS (if applicable)**

## Steps Completed

1. **Refactored HTML** to integrate Bootstrap classes.
2. **Replaced traditional CSS layout** with Bootstrap Grid and Flexbox utilities.
3. Used **pre-built Bootstrap components** like:
   - Navbar
   - Cards
   - Buttons
   - Container and Row layouts
4. **Customized component styles** using custom CSS where necessary to match the desired design.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Make sure you have internet access to load Bootstrap CDN. If not, you can install it locally.
